"""The application builds and answers, without a database behind it.

These do not start the lifespan, so there is no pool and no settings store.
That is the point: the container has to survive Postgres being slow to start or
briefly gone, and a process that cannot even build its routes in that state
gives you nothing to look at when you need it most.
